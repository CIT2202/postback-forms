# Submitting a form to the same page
* Open *postback.php* in an code editor and view it through a browser (it must be on a server).
* Enter something for the email address and hit submit. The page should reload, and you should get a 'Valid form' message.
* Now try submitting the form without entering anything into the email field. You should get a 'You need to complete all the fields' message.
* Have a good look at the code in *postback.php* and make sure you understand how this is working.  
* Add some more code to *postback.php* to test that the user has completed the fullname text field.
* Notice how if we enter an email address, the email text field is re-populated with this value. Do the same for the fullname field.
