# Postback Forms
* Open *html-forms.html* and *form-validate.php* in an code editor.
* Some simple form processing has been set up already. Make sure it works. View *html-forms.html* through a browser (it must be on a server). Enter something for the email address and hit submit. The data you entered should be displayed.
* Now try and submit the form without entering an email address. You should get a 'You need to complete all the fields' message. Have a good look in *form-validate.php* and try and understand how this works.
* Add more code to *form-validate.php* that will check the other fields in the form.
